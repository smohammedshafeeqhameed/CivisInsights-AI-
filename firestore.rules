/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CivisInsights AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, with an admin override for user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Only the user themselves can read/write their profile, except for admins who can read all profiles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed for non-admins. This prevents unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - Roles are denormalized directly onto the user document to simplify authorization checks.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
