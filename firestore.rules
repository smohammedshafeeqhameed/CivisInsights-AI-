/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CivisInsights AI Application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user's profile is stored under `/users/{userId}`,
 * and only the authenticated user matching the `userId` can read or write to their own profile.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under the `/users/{userId}` collection path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - The rules validate that the `id` field within a user document matches the `userId` in the path for create and update operations
 *   to prevent data inconsistencies.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The rules rely on path-based authorization, where the `userId` parameter in the path `/users/{userId}` is compared against
 *  `request.auth.uid`.  This avoids the need for additional reads (e.g., `get()`) to determine user identity or ownership.
 *  To create simpler, more performant rules, denormalize (copy) data required for an authorization decision directly onto the documents being secured. This avoids slow, costly, or impossible security checks.

     * @allow (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with UID 'user_abc' can get, update, or delete their own profile.
     * @deny (create) - Authenticated user with UID 'user_xyz' cannot create a profile under /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with UID 'user_xyz' cannot get, update, or delete the profile of user 'user_abc'.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all read and write operations on user profiles.
